# Node Cli Package repo

Experimental cli package created using nodejs (and maybe python)

## Packages to use

- `chalk`: for terminal colors and styling.
- `commander`: Main cli api
- `yargs`: Other cli api more geared towards processing args.
- `minimist`: Minimal version of optimist, which is what yargs is based off of.
- `fs-extra`: Drop in replacement for `node:fs`.
- `argparse`: an alternative argument parsing option for nodejs, which came from python's `argparse` library.

## Which one is best?

For basic nodejs scripting and cli work, `commander` is handy.  But `yargs` supports automatic _bash-completion_ scripts... so Idk yet.

## Notes
